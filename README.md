# PaperJS Seed


### Getting Started

1. To get you started you can simply clone the paperjs-seed repository:

    ```
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/paperjs-seed.git <your-project-name>
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```
    npm install && bower install
    ```


3. We use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) as a task-runner for this project. It's been pre-configured with a simple development web server and live-reload. The simplest way to start this server is:

    ```
    gulp dev
    ```

4. Now browse to the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
